""" PySceneDetect scenedetect.video_stream Tests

This file includes unit tests for the scenedetect.video_stream module, as well as the video
backends implemented in scenedetect.backends.  These tests enforce a consistent interface across
all supported backends, and verify that they are functionally equivalent where possible.
